# Factorial_Launcher
Windows Phone Inspired Launcher, written in Kotlin

Currently the project is in a really early stage, and a lot of basic features are missing. 

A short demo:

Note**
Overhauled the home screen completely. Replaced the old RecyclerView home screen with Google's FlexBox Layout and populate it with actual views. This will make it easier to update live tiles and support animations, but due to the overhaul, I need more time to re-add the features that I already implemented with RecyclerView, and I will update the apk release once it's done.



Todo:

1. properly design live tiles
2. Enable search
3. Enable live tiles hosting Android widgets
4. Settings
5. Launch app animation
6. Optimize for speed
7. App list guesture
8. Homescreen gesture
